# africa-intercropping
I examine whether greater access to an innovative intercropping system allows african smallholder farmers to produce more nutritious crops such as maize alongside cash crops. Simulating such a program implementation in Lira Uganda, I found that the program succeeds in getting farmers to switch to the push-pull method as the farmer were more than happy to adopt the new strategies. Comparing members that were assigned push-pull to those who were not, I found that push-pull method increases participation in this program, and it translates into more fertile soil and higher crop yield. This suggests that smallholder farmers require access not only to better farming inputs, but to the use of more innovative agricultural technology such as the ones used in the push-pull intercropping system.
